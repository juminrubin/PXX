Instruction:
From the SEC filing input, extract the vote cast on TESLA, INC (ticker TSLA) issue/proposal number 1 on the 21-Mar-18 special meeting.
Issue 1 is titled "Approve Grant of Performance-Based Stock Option Award" but another phrasing such as "Approve Stock Option Grant to Elon Musk" or "Approval of Performance Stock Option Agreement" may be used.
Consider only the issue mentioned, disregard any other issues/proposals in the input.
Consider only the actual vote, ignore any Management Recommendation.
Your response must be a single word, do not explain your reasoning.
Your response must be "For" or "Against", or "None" if no vote was cast on the specific proposal mentioned, "Multiple" if the input contains multiple instances of the same meeting dates and proposals, or "Absent" if the input is not relevant.
